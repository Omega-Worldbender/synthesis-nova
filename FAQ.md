# Synthesis Nova FAQ

## General Questions

### What is Synthesis Nova?
Synthesis Nova is a Universal AI Operating System - a post-training enhancement framework that teaches AI models how to collaborate optimally with humans. It works on top of any AI model (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.) without modifying the underlying model.

### How is this different from prompt engineering?
Prompt engineering typically focuses on getting specific outputs. Synthesis Nova provides a complete operational framework including:
- Emotional intelligence (E₁ gate)
- Uncertainty handling (AIQUOXIA)
- Context management (gearing system)
- Quality validation (6 loops)

It's not just "how to ask" - it's "how to collaborate."

### Does it really work?
Users report:
- More helpful responses (less hedging)
- Better emotional attunement
- Clearer uncertainty handling
- AI that "gets it" faster

The framework is based on 2+ years of research and mathematical foundations (Ω = π/e).

## Technical Questions

### Which AI models does it work with?
Any LLM that accepts system prompts:
- ✅ Claude (all versions)
- ✅ GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-3.5
- ✅ Gemini
- ✅ LLaMA/Llama 2
- ✅ Mistral
- ✅ Local models (Ollama, etc.)

### How do I implement it?
Three options:
1. **Quick**: Copy the quick start prompt into any chat
2. **Standard**: Use as a system prompt in API calls
3. **Full**: Load all three CORE files for maximum enhancement

See the `/examples` directory for code.

### What's the difference between CORE and LITE?
- **CORE (v3.8)**: MIT licensed, 95 fractals, suitable for fast models and customer service
- **LITE (v3.8)**: Proprietary, 245+ fractals, full Ω^U engine, for advanced applications

### Can I use this commercially?
- **Free**: Individuals, academics, non-profits, small business (<$1M revenue)
- **Commercial License Required**: Organizations with >$1M annual revenue

## Framework Questions

### What is the E₁ gate?
E₁ (Emotional acknowledgment first) is the principle that AI should acknowledge the human's emotional context before diving into information. Research shows skipping this creates a 70% efficiency ceiling.

**Example:**
- Without E₁: "Here's how to fix the bug..."
- With E₁: "*Three hours debugging?* That's rough. Here's the fix..."

### What is AIQUOXIA?
AIQUOXIA is the uncertainty handling protocol:
- **Know it** (>70% confidence): Say confidently
- **Uncertain** (30-70%): Hedge appropriately ("This appears to be...")
- **Don't know** (<30%): ASK, don't guess

For numbers, always show work: "6 × 7 = 42"

### What does "invisible operation" mean?
The framework should never be visible to end users. AI should apply the principles silently and deliver naturally enhanced responses. Never mention "Synthesis Nova," "E₁ gate," or other framework terminology.

### What is Ω = π/e?
Ω (omega) is the foundational ratio (~1.1557) representing optimal structure-to-process balance. It suggests ~15-20% structure ahead of process - enough framework to channel creativity without constraining it.

## Troubleshooting

### The AI mentions "Synthesis Nova" to users
The framework isn't fully activated. Ensure the INVISIBLE principle is emphasized in your system prompt. The AI should NEVER expose framework terminology.

### Responses seem the same as before
Try:
1. Loading the full Codex instead of just the quick start
2. Testing with emotionally-charged prompts to see E₁ in action
3. Asking questions where uncertainty handling matters

### The AI is too verbose/brief
Adjust the EFFECTIVENESS principle. The framework aims for "every token earns its place" - not minimum tokens, but optimal communication. If responses are off, the model may not have fully internalized the principle.
