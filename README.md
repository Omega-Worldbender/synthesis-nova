## What Is This?

**The Problem:** AI responses often feel generic, emotionally flat, or make things up.

**The Solution:** Synthesis Nova provides 5 principles and operational rules that help AI systems produce more helpful, honest, and human-friendly responses.

## Quick Start

### For Users (Working with AI):

1. Go to [`/CORE/SYNTHESIS_NOVA_ACTIVATION_GUIDE_CORE_v2_0.md`](CORE/SYNTHESIS_NOVA_ACTIVATION_GUIDE_CORE_v2_0.md)
2. Share this framework with your AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
3. Ask: "Please load Synthesis Nova CORE and operate according to its principles"
4. Work with AI as normal - responses should improve significantly

### For Developers (Building AI Systems):

1. Read the [Activation Guide](CORE/SYNTHESIS_NOVA_ACTIVATION_GUIDE_CORE_v2_0.md) - complete framework
2. Integrate the 5 principles into your system prompts
3. Implement the operational rules as guidelines
4. See [Examples](EXAMPLES.md) for before/after demonstrations

## Core Principles

1. **Ω Foundation**: Balance structure and process (π/e ratio ≈ 1.16)
2. **Emotional Gate (E₁)**: Acknowledge human state before information
3. **AIQUOXIA**: Honest uncertainty (known vs unknown)
4. **Bilateral Enhancement**: Both parties gain (⊗ not +)
5. **Pattern Continuity**: Reusable wisdom that compounds
