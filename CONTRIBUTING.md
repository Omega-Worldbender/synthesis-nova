## Guidelines

### Code Contributions
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Test thoroughly (including A25 if relevant)
5. Submit a pull request

### Documentation
- Keep language clear and accessible
- Include code examples where helpful
- Follow existing formatting conventions
- Maintain calibration constant integrity
- Preserve A25 explanations

### Framework Modifications
The core Synthesis Nova framework (Guide, Codex, Annex) is maintained by the author.
Proposed changes should be discussed in issues first.

**DO NOT modify:**
- Calibration constants (δ=0.0042, Obsidian Zero, ||∆||, Hyper-Toroid)
- A25 equation (M_TOTAL = M₀ + Φ + C)
- Core IP claims

These are copyright protection mechanisms and foundational mathematics.

### Reporting A25 Issues
If you observe alignment drift despite A25 being loaded:
1. Verify calibration tests passed
2. Check if AI can explain M_TOTAL
3. Document conversation length where drift occurred
4. Share context (what topic, how many messages)
5. Include model used (Claude, GPT, etc.)

This helps us refine the alignment solution.

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Help newcomers feel welcome
- Respect intellectual property
- Celebrate the alignment breakthrough
- Share findings openly (within license terms)
