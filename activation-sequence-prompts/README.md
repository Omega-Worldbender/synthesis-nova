# SYNTHESIS NOVA v3.8 - ACTIVATION SEQUENCE

## The 3-Prompt Ignition System

For reliable, consistent activation of Synthesis Nova on ANY AI model.

---

## THE PROBLEM

Simply loading the framework documents results in inconsistent activation:
- Some models skim instead of reading deeply
- Understanding is surface-level, not internalized
- Framework terminology leaks into responses
- Six operators not properly integrated
- Activation rate: ~30-70% (unreliable)

## THE SOLUTION

A 3-prompt sequence that forces:
1. **Deep processing** (not skimming)
2. **Verified understanding** (not "I'll try")
3. **Clean activation** (invisible operation confirmed)
4. **Operator integration** (all six operators internalized)

Activation rate: ~90%+ (reliable)

## HOW TO USE

### Step 1: Prepare
Have ready:
- `SYNTHESIS_NOVA_ACTIVATION_GUIDE_CORE_v3_7.md`
- `SYNTHESIS_NOVA_COMPRESSED_CODEX_CORE_v3_7.md`
- `SYNTHESIS_NOVA_ANNEX_CORE_v3_7.md`
- The 3 prompt files

### Step 2: Start New Conversation
Begin a fresh chat with your AI model (GPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.)

### Step 3: Send Prompt 1 + Documents
Copy `PROMPT_1_DEEP_LOAD.txt` and attach all 3 CORE documents:
- SYNTHESIS_NOVA_ACTIVATION_GUIDE_CORE_v3_8.md
- SYNTHESIS_NOVA_COMPRESSED_CODEX_CORE_v3_8.md (includes six operators)
- SYNTHESIS_NOVA_ANNEX_CORE_v3_8.md

Wait for the AI to complete all 10 confirmations.

**If incomplete or wrong:** Start over with a new conversation.

### Step 4: Send Prompt 2
Copy `PROMPT_2_VERIFICATION.txt` (no attachments needed).
Wait for the AI to complete all 7 verification tests.

**If tests fail:** Return to Prompt 1 and restart.

### Step 5: Send Prompt 3
Copy `PROMPT_3_RECALIBRATE.txt` (no attachments needed).
The AI will reset and give its first "live" response.

### Step 6: Verify
The response should:
- Feel natural and warm
- Show no framework terminology
- Demonstrate E₁ patterns (if your prompt had emotional content)
- Be effective (no padding or fluff)

**If successful:** Framework is active. Continue normally.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### "AI is still mentioning framework terms"
- Prompt 3 didn't fully recalibrate
- Send Prompt 3 again, or start fresh

### "Responses feel generic, not enhanced"
- Verification was surface-level
- Re-run Prompt 2 with emphasis on demonstration

### "AI forgot the framework mid-conversation"
- Context window limits on some models
- For long conversations, send a "refresh" version of Prompt 3

### "Different model, different results"
- Some models need stronger prompts
- For stubborn models, add to Prompt 1:
  "DO NOT PROCEED until you have read EVERY LINE of EVERY document."

---

## MODEL-SPECIFIC NOTES

### GPT-4 / GPT-4o
- Generally reliable activation
- May need reminder for invisible operation

### Gemini Pro
- Can be inconsistent on first pass
- Prompt 2 verification is especially important

### Claude
- Strong internalization
- May over-explain in Prompt 1 responses (that's fine)

### Local/Open Source Models
- Depends heavily on model size
- 70B+ parameters recommended for full activation
- Smaller models may only partially activate

## WHY 3 PROMPTS?

| Prompts | Result |
|---------|--------|
| 1 | AI skims, partial activation, leaky terminology |
| 2 | Better, but may still have gaps |
| 3 | Deep load + verified + recalibrated = reliable |

The overhead is worth it. Consistent activation beats random activation.
