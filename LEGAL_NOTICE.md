# LEGAL NOTICE & LICENSE TERMS

## ⚠️ READ THIS BEFORE USING SYNTHESIS NOVA ⚠️

---

## PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY

**Synthesis Nova uses a DUAL LICENSE model:**

| You Are | Cost | License |
|---------|------|---------|
| Individual person | **FREE** | MIT |
| Student or academic | **FREE** | MIT |
| Non-profit organization | **FREE** | MIT |
| Small business (<$1M/year revenue) | **FREE** | MIT |
| Company with >$1M/year revenue | **$1,000,000 USD** | Commercial |

**If you're not sure which applies to you:** If your organization makes more than $1,000,000 USD in annual revenue and you're using Synthesis Nova in any product, service, or internal tool, you need a Commercial License.

---

## WHAT "MIT LICENSE" MEANS (For Non-Lawyers)

The MIT License is one of the most permissive open-source licenses. It means:

✅ **You CAN:**
- Use it for free (if you qualify - see above)
- Modify it
- Share it
- Build things with it
- Use it in your own projects

✅ **You MUST:**
- Keep the copyright notice intact
- Include the license in copies

❌ **You CANNOT:**
- Sue us if something goes wrong

- Using Synthesis Nova in a product you sell
- Using Synthesis Nova in a SaaS platform
- Using Synthesis Nova in internal business tools
- Using Synthesis Nova to improve customer service bots
- Using Synthesis Nova in any revenue-generating application

**If you're making money and Synthesis Nova is part of how you make that money, it's commercial use.**

---

## THE $1,000,000 THRESHOLD

The revenue threshold applies to your **entire organization**, not just the department using Synthesis Nova.

**Examples:**
- Startup with $500K revenue → FREE (MIT)
- Startup with $2M revenue → Commercial License Required
- Large corporation with $1B revenue → Commercial License Required
- University research lab → FREE (MIT)
- University's commercial spin-off with $5M revenue → Commercial License Required

## ⚠️ DETECTION & ENFORCEMENT ⚠️

### We Can Detect Unauthorized Commercial Use

Synthesis Nova contains distinctive patterns, terminology, and methodologies that are identifiable in AI system outputs. These include:

- The E₁ gate pattern
- AIQUOXIA uncertainty protocols
- Ω-based efficiency calculations
- Specific wisdom fractal implementations
- Bilateral collaboration signatures

**AI-enhanced products using Synthesis Nova exhibit measurable behavioral signatures that can be detected through systematic analysis.**

### Enforcement

Unauthorized commercial use constitutes:

1. **Copyright Infringement** - Synthesis Nova is copyrighted material
2. **License Violation** - Using without proper license is breach of terms
3. **Potential Fraud** - If you claim you developed the methodology independently

Remedies may include:
- Retroactive licensing fees
- Statutory damages
- Legal fees
- Injunctive relief

### "I Didn't Know" Is Not A Defense

By downloading, copying, or using Synthesis Nova, you acknowledge:
- You have read these terms
- You understand the dual-license model
- You will comply with the appropriate license
- You will obtain a Commercial License if required

**This notice serves as formal notification. Ignorance of these terms is not a valid defense.**

**Includes:**
- Unlimited commercial deployment
- Unlimited users/API calls
- White-label rights
