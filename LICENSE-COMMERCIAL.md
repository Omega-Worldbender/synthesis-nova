## 1. DEFINITIONS

**"Framework"** means the Synthesis Nova cognitive framework, including but not limited to:

### 1.1 Core Mathematical Elements
- The Omega ratio: Ω = π/e
- The Negentropy flux equation: Ṅ = Φ · η · σ / (k_B · T)
- The Bilateral Enhancement formula: AI ⊗ Human ⊗ Coherence

### 1.2 AI Cognitive Operators
- Additive operations (+) - combination, accumulation
- Subtractive operations (−) - filtering, SEAR protocol
- Multiplicative operations (×) - amplification, bilateral gain
- Divisive operations (÷) - compression, Ω^C ratios
- Power law operations (^) - tier progression, exponential coherence
- Tensor product operations (⊗) - bilateral enhancement, emergence

### 1.3 Methodologies and Protocols
- SEAR (Suppress, Eliminate, Avoid, Reduce)
- Phoenix Protocol (context compression and transfer)
- AIQUOXIA (uncertainty handling)
- Tier System (cognitive depth progression)
- Wisdom Fractals (pattern libraries)
- All operational frameworks derived therefrom

### 1.4 Documentation
- CORE, LITE, KAIROS variants and any future versions
- All guides, codexes, annexes, and reference materials

**"Use"** means any of the following activities:
- Loading the Framework into any AI system
- Implementing the AI Cognitive Operators in any form
- Incorporating Framework principles into system design
- Training or fine-tuning AI models on Framework documentation
- Creating derivative works based on Framework concepts
- Deploying systems that implement Framework methodologies
- Any commercial exploitation of Framework concepts

**"Commercial Use"** means Use by any entity that:
- Has annual gross revenue exceeding $1,000,000 USD, OR
- Has received more than $1,000,000 USD in total funding, OR
- Employs more than 50 full-time employees, OR
- Is publicly traded on any stock exchange, OR
- Is a subsidiary or affiliate of any entity meeting the above criteria

**"Derivative Work"** means any work that:
- Implements the AI Cognitive Operators (+−×÷^⊗) for AI cognition
- Uses the tensor product (⊗) for human-AI interaction
- Applies the mathematical relationships (Ω = π/e) in any form
- Implements SEAR, compression, or tier-based architectures
- Would not exist in its current form without Framework exposure

## 2. THE CORE INNOVATION

### 2.1 What Makes This Framework Unique

Current AI systems operate using only additive (+) operations. The Framework defines the complete operator set for AI cognition:

```
+  −  ×  ÷  ^  ⊗
```

**This is analogous to inventing arithmetic for AI systems.**

### 2.2 Why This Matters for Licensing

Any AI Operating System, cognitive framework, or human-AI collaboration system that implements:
- Subtractive filtering (SEAR-like operations)
- Multiplicative enhancement (bilateral gain)
- Divisive compression (Ω^C-like ratios)
- Power law progression (tier systems)
- Tensor product collaboration (⊗ operations)

Is likely a derivative work requiring a commercial license.

## 3. LICENSE GRANT - COMMERCIAL ENTITIES

### 3.1 License Required

Commercial Use of the Framework requires a separate commercial license agreement.

**NO RIGHTS ARE GRANTED FOR COMMERCIAL USE UNDER THIS DOCUMENT.**

### 3.2 Contact for Licensing

Commercial licensing inquiries:
- Email: licensing@synthesisnova.ai
- General: worldbender@synthesisnova.ai
- GitHub: https://github.com/Omega-Worldbender
- Website: https://synthesisnova.ai

### 3.3 Unlicensed Commercial Use

Any Commercial Use without a valid license constitutes:
- Copyright infringement
- Breach of license terms
- Grounds for legal action

---

## 4. DERIVATIVE WORKS

### 4.1 Prohibition

**NO DERIVATIVE WORKS ARE PERMITTED FOR COMMERCIAL USE** without explicit written authorization.

### 4.2 Specific Prohibitions

The following are derivative works requiring authorization:
- AI operating systems implementing the cognitive operators
- System prompts using SEAR or subtractive methodologies
- Frameworks implementing bilateral enhancement (⊗)
- Tier-based cognitive progression systems
- Compression protocols similar to Ω^C
- "Clean room" implementations following Framework architecture
- Any substantially similar cognitive frameworks

### 4.3 Independent Development Defense

Claims of "independent development" by entities with prior Framework access require clear and convincing evidence of:
- Development timeline predating Framework exposure
- No access by any contributor
- Fundamental architectural differences
- No implementation of the AI Cognitive Operators
